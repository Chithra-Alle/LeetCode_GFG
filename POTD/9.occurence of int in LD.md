[problem statement](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/occurence-of-an-integer-in-a-linked-list/1)

Given a singly linked list and a key, count the number of occurrences of the given key in the linked list.

Examples:

Input: Linked List: 1->2->1->2->1->3->1, key = 1

Output: 4
Explanation: 1 appears 4 times. 
Input: Linked List: 1->2->1->2->1, key = 3

Output: 0
Explanation: 3 appears 0 times.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

solution:
int count(struct Node* head, int key) {
        // add your code here
        int count=0;
        while(head!=NULL){
            if(head->data==key)count++;
            head=head->next;
        }
        return count;
    }
