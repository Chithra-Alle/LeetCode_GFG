[Problem statement](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/split-the-array0238/1)

Given an array arr[] of integers, the task is to count the number of ways to split given array elements into two non-empty subsets such that the XOR of elements of each group is equal. Each element should belong to exactly one subset.
Note:

The answer could be very large so print it by doing modulo with 109 + 7. 
Subsets with the same elements but derived from different indices are different.
Examples:

Input : arr[] = [1, 2, 3]
Output : 3
Explanation: {(1),(2, 3)}, {(2),(1, 3)}, {(3),(1, 2)} are three ways with equal XOR value of two groups.
Input : arr[] = [5, 2, 3, 2]
Output : 0
Explanation: No way to split into  two groups whose XOR is equal.
Input : arr[] = [2, 2, 2, 2]
Output : 7
Explanation: There are 7 ways to split the array into two groups with equal XOR, such that there are multiple combinations of {(2), (2,2,2)},{(2,2),(2,2)}.


My solution:
    int countgroup(vector<int>& arr)
    {
        int count=0;
        long long l=0;
        const int MOD = 1000000007;
        for(int i=0;i<arr.size();i++){
            l= (l^arr[i])%MOD;
        }
        if(l==0){
            count = (1<<(arr.size()-1))-1;
        }
        return count;
    }
