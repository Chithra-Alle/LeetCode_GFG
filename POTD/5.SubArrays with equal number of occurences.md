[Problem Statement](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sub-arrays-with-equal-number-of-occurences3901/1)

Given an array arr[] and two integers say, x and y, find the number of sub-arrays in which the number of occurrences of x is equal to the number of occurrences of y.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 1] , x= 1 , y = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: The possible sub-arrays have same equal number of occurrences of x and y are:
1) [1, 2], x and y have same occurrence(1).
2) [2, 1], x and y have same occurrence(1).
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 1] , x = 4 , y = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: The possible sub-arrays have same equal number of occurrences of x and y are:
1) [1], x and y have same occurrence(0).
2) [2], x and y have same occurrence(0).
3) [1], x and y have same occurrence(0).
4) [1, 2], x and y have same occurrence(0).
5) [2, 1], x and y have same occurrence(0).
6) [1, 2, 1], x and y have same occurrence(0).
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 1] , x= 1 , y = 4
Output: 1
Explanation: The possible sub-array have same equal number of occurrences of x and y is: [2], x and y have same occurrence(0)


Solution:
int sameOccurrence(vector<int>& arr, int x, int y)
{
        map<int,int>mp;
        mp[0]=1;
        int count=0,res=0;
        for(auto it:arr){
            if(it==x)count++;
            if(it==y)count--;
            if(mp[count])res+=mp[count];
            mp[count]+=1;
        }
        return res;
}
